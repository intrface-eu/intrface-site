function renderCommitPrompt(scope: string): string {

	return `Run the AOC/OMP commit workflow for this prompt-first intent: ${target}

The user's /commit invocation is approval to run the full VCS-aware commit flow directly: inspect, select a safe atomic change set, commit with the detected repository workflow, and report the result. Treat the text after /commit as the primary commit intent/scope; use recent session edits and related dirty work only when they support that intent. Never push unless explicitly requested.

Workflow:

1. Detect preferred VCS mode, then inspect read-only state
- Prefer startup context VCS metadata. If it is unavailable or stale, run \`aoc-handshake --json\`.
- If the handshake reports \`preferredTool: "git"\`, use normal Git flow even when \`.jj\` metadata is present:
  - git status --short
  - git diff --stat
  - git diff --cached --stat
  - targeted diffs for candidate files only
- If the handshake reports \`preferredTool: "jj"\`, run narrow Jujutsu summaries:
  - jj status
  - jj diff --summary
  - jj diff --stat
  - targeted jj diff -- <filesets> when needed
- Identify unrelated/pre-existing changes and exclude or split them before committing, even if they were edited in the same working copy.

2. Resolve provenance
- Identify relevant task/subtask/spec from recent implementation context, Taskmaster, or explicit user instructions.
- Use tm/aoc-task only when it materially improves commit provenance.
- Do not use broad Mind/STM recall unless a focused missing-provenance question requires it.

3. Plan atomic commit(s)
- Start prompt-first: infer the intended commit slice from the /commit arguments; if they are empty, use the current completed work from the session.
- Include only files that are part of that coherent intent: directly edited session files plus related dirty work needed for correctness.
- Group by intent, not by timestamp.
- Prefer one commit for one coherent implementation slice.
- Git uses explicit staging; never stage broad paths like .
- Jujutsu has no Git staging area: the working copy is the current mutable @ change, and jj commit without filesets selects all current changes.
- Use Jujutsu commit/split semantics only when \`aoc-handshake --json\` reports \`preferredTool: "jj"\`.
- In a colocated repository with an attached Git branch, \`preferredTool\` is Git; use \`git add -- <paths>\` and \`git commit\`, not \`jj split\` or \`jj describe\`.
- If Jujutsu @ is mixed and Jujutsu is the preferred tool, default to a selected-fileset/split workflow (jj commit -m <message> <filesets> or jj split <filesets>) so unrelated work remains in the new/current change; use jj squash -i only when it is the clearer way to reshape already-separated changes.
- If the intended slice is unclear after inspecting the prompt, session context, and targeted diffs, ask one concise clarification before mutating.

4. Draft commit message
Use:

<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>

Include a concise body plus trailers when known:

AOC-Task: <id>
AOC-Subtask: <id.n>
AOC-PRD: <path>
AOC-Intent: <durable intent>
Tests: <commands run/results>
Risk: low|medium|high; <reason>

5. Validate, commit directly, then refresh CodeGraph cache
- Run targeted validation appropriate to the selected files when practical.
- Git preferred: stage only explicit paths with git add -- path ..., commit, and report the observed SHA.
- Jujutsu preferred: verify @ contains only the intended atomic work before plain jj commit -m <message> or use jj describe -m <message> plus the workflow-appropriate new-change step.
- Jujutsu preferred with mixed @: when the intended fileset is clear, use jj commit -m <message> <filesets> or jj split <filesets> to isolate/commit the prompt-selected slice and leave unrelated changes behind.
- If no safe atomic set can be inferred from the prompt, session context, and targeted diffs, ask one concise clarification before staging or mutating.
- Never push unless explicitly requested.
- After a successful commit only, if \`.codegraph/\` exists and \`codegraph\` is on PATH, run \`codegraph sync <repo-root>\` as best-effort cache maintenance.
- Never run CodeGraph sync before the commit, never include \`.codegraph/**\` in the commit, and never let sync failure change, undo, block, or invalidate the committed VCS result.
- If sync fails or is unavailable, report it as advisory cache status and continue the final commit report.

Final response after commit:
- Git commit SHA or Jujutsu change/commit identity
- subject
- files committed
- tests noted
- CodeGraph cache status: synced | skipped (no index/CLI) | failed (advisory; reason)
- remaining unrelated changes, if any

Safety:
- Treat /commit as approval to commit only the safe atomic change set inferred from the prompt, recent session context, and targeted diffs.
- Never commit secrets/tokens/private logs.
- Never push without explicit push approval.
- Do not include raw chain-of-thought or huge diffs in commit messages.`;
