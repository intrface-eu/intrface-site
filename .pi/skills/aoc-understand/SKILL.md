# AOC Understand

Use `aoc-understand` when the user wants to understand a repo, onboard, ask architecture questions, inspect graph relationships, explain a file/function, analyze code impact, or launch an interactive knowledge graph dashboard.

This is the umbrella Understand-Anything skill. Do not expose or require the upstream granular skills (`understand`, `understand-chat`, `understand-dashboard`, `understand-diff`, `understand-domain`, `understand-explain`, `understand-knowledge`, `understand-onboard`) in normal AOC skill inventory; route those modes through this skill instead.

## Canonical flow

1. Check status:
   ```bash
   aoc-understand status
   ```
2. If Understand-Anything is not installed and the user explicitly wants setup:
   ```bash
   aoc-understand install
   ```
3. Build/update the graph through the umbrella flow:
   ```bash
   aoc-understand analyze --full
   # or invoke: /skill:aoc-understand analyze --full
   ```
4. Explore:
   ```bash
   aoc-understand dashboard --open
   aoc-understand chat "How does auth work?"
   aoc-understand explain src/file.ts
   aoc-understand onboard
   aoc-understand domain
   aoc-understand diff
   ```
5. Optional curated AOC Map bridge:
   ```bash
   aoc-understand map-sync
   aoc-map serve --open
   ```

## Umbrella modes

Use the operator's requested mode to select the appropriate flow inside this skill:

- `analyze` / `full` / repo graph: run `aoc-understand status`, then `aoc-understand analyze --full`; follow the printed guidance.
- `dashboard`: run `aoc-understand dashboard --open` after a graph exists.
- `chat QUERY`: use `aoc-understand chat "QUERY"` and answer from graph slices/search results, not by loading the whole graph.
- `explain TARGET`: use `aoc-understand explain TARGET` plus targeted file/graph inspection.
- `onboard`: use `aoc-understand onboard` to produce a newcomer-oriented repo guide.
- `domain`: use `aoc-understand domain` for business/domain flow extraction.
- `diff`: use `aoc-understand diff` for change impact analysis.
- `gaps`: use `aoc-understand gaps [focus]` or `/skill:aoc-gaps` for the broader AOC gap audit workflow.

## Mental model

- Understand-Anything owns the deep generated knowledge graph under `.understand-anything/`.
- AOC owns safe install/status/doctor/project-root routing through `aoc-understand`.
- AOC Map remains the curated offline visual microsite under `.aoc/map/`.
- Open Design remains the GUI design studio bridge through `aoc-od`.

## Teach deprecation

Do not start new work with `/teach`, `/teach-full`, `/teach-dive`, or `teach-workflow` unless the operator explicitly asks to inspect legacy artifacts. Use `aoc-understand` instead.

## Guardrails

- Do not run remote curl installers. Use `aoc-understand install` for explicit clone/update.
- Do not load the full `.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json` into context. Search/slice it first.
- Do not delete `.aoc/insight/`; legacy teach notes may still be useful history.
- Treat `aoc-understand map-sync` as a curated bridge, not a replacement for the full dashboard.
